The heart disease prediction project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. Using a dataset containing features like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical indicators, the model is trained to identify patterns and correlations that could indicate the presence of heart disease. By applying algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks, the project aims to provide a predictive tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
